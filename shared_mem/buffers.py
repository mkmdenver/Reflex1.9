"""
Double ring buffers per symbol for high-throughput ingestion.

- Quotes remain memory-only (policy).
- Trades are persisted to DB by writers; buffers provide recent slices for bar building.
- get_short(): drain-and-return recent events (used by bar_builder as a minute bucket).

Design:
  Each buffer is a lock-protected double deque. Writers append to 'active'.
  Readers call drain() which atomically swaps active<->drain and returns the drained items.
